## Results & Findings

### GHZ vs W robustness
We compared GHZ_3 and W_3 under depolarizing noise using structure metrics:
- GHZ metric: P(000) + P(111)
- W metric:   P(001) + P(010) + P(100)

Observed behavior:
- GHZ tends to lose its ideal subspace mass sharply as noise increases (fragile multipartite coherence).
- W degrades more smoothly, reflecting a more robust entanglement structure under local noise.

This highlights that multipartite entanglement is not a single “resource”: different entangled families respond differently to decoherence.
