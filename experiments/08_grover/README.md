# Chapter 8 — Grover under Noise with Agentic Control

This chapter studies Grover’s search algorithm in noisy environments and introduces an agentic stopping rule.

Results show that under depolarizing noise, increasing the number of Grover iterations eventually degrades performance. A classical agent monitors success probability and adaptively halts the algorithm when additional iterations become detrimental.

This demonstrates that in NISQ settings, adaptive control strategies can preserve quantum advantage better than fixed-depth circuits.
