## Module 01 — Single-Qubit Gates

This module introduces the fundamental building blocks of quantum computation:

- quantum superposition,
- relative phase,
- quantum interference,
- state fidelity.

### Experiments

**Experiment 01 — Hadamard Superposition**  
Demonstrates the creation of a balanced superposition from the |0⟩ state.

**Experiment 02 — Phase Invisible in the Z Basis**  
Shows that phase changes do not affect measurement probabilities in the computational basis.

**Experiment 03 — Phase Revealed by Interference (HZH)**  
Illustrates how interference converts relative phase into measurable amplitude differences.

### Conclusion
These experiments establish the conceptual foundation for quantum algorithms and NISQ-era analysis.
